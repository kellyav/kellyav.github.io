# kellyav.github.io

I already started a website where I blog: https://kellyav0.wixsite.com/thehungrynerd.

But, I wanted to take a stab at creating my own website from scratch, using GitHub Pages. So, this is my attempt at doing so!

Check it out in the meantime, while I get my GitHub Page working!


## The Hungry Nerd blog on GitHub

Check out my GitHub Page! https://kellyav.github.io. It's brand-spanking new. Still learning HTML, CSS, and JS so any advice is appreciated :) 

## Beginners Guide to HTML
This folder is for html tips and tricks that helped me get started! (And a great place to look back to as a learner myself!).
