# Here's some HTML Basics: 
Basically my step one in this process. 

## HTML Headings
defined with the <h1> to <h6> tags.

<h1> defines the most important heading. <h6> defines the least important heading: 

```
<h1>This is heading 1</h1>
<h2>This is heading 2</h2>
```


## HTML Paragraphs
defined with the <p> tag:

```
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
```

## HTML Links
defined with the <a> tag:

```
<a href="https://www.w3schools.com">This is a link</a>
```

## HTML images
defined with the '<img>' tag.

The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes:

```
<img src="image.jpg" alt="github.com" width="104" height="142">
```
